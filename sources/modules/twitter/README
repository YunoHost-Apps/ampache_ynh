To enable twitter support to work for Ampache you have to first
have to register an app from Twitter's site.
http://dev.twitter.com/apps/new is the registration page.  After you
have registered you will be presented with two keys that you will need
to add to you ampache.cfg.php file.  To enable it you need to add the
next three lines to your ampache.cfg.php file.

twitter = true
twitter_consumer_key = "my_consumer_key"
twitter_consumer_secret = "my_consumer_secret"

After that you will see the Twitter 't' icon on the now playing section
of the Amapche front page.  Enjoy.
